# About
This is a personal organization created by [tigerros](https://github.com/tigerros) which hosts various open source .NET libraries.

### The Name
The word "kontore" is a plural form of "[kontor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kontor)", which was a foreign trading post of the [Hanseatic League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanseatic_League). I'd like to think that a repository inside this organization represents an individual kontor and that .NET represents the proper Hanseatic cities.

### The Icon
The organization icon is the Stralsund Town Hall <sup>\[[German](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stralsunder_Rathaus)\]</sup>, a Brick Gothic building tied to the Hanseatic League. I picked it simply because I liked it, but I will switch to a simpler, more abstract icon in the future. However, I will attempt to redraw the photo instead of picking a new icon.

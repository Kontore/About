# About
This is a personal organization created by [tigerros](https://github.com/tigerros) which hosts various open source .NET libraries.

### Kontore
The word "kontore" is a plural form of "[kontor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kontor)", which was a foreign trading post of the [Hanseatic League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanseatic_League). I'd like to think that a repository inside this organization represents an individual kontor and that .NET represents the proper Hanseatic cities.

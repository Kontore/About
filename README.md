# About
This is a personal organization created by [tigerros](https://github.com/tigerros) which hosts various open source .NET libraries.

### The Name
The word "kontore" is a plural form of "[kontor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kontor)", which was a foreign trading post of the [Hanseatic League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanseatic_League). I'd like to think that a repository inside this organization represents an individual kontor and that .NET represents the proper Hanseatic cities.

### The Icon
The organization icon is the Stralsund Town Hall <sup>\[[German](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stralsunder_Rathaus)\]</sup>, a Brick Gothic building tied to the Hanseatic League. 

It is obviously a strange icon for any sort of tech organization, but I do plan on changing it. However, I will attempt to redraw the photo into a simpler and more abstract form instead of picking a new icon.

*Note: There is no english version of the German wikipedia page on the Stralsund Town Hall. However, I used Google Translate to produce an imperfect, but good enough [English version](https://de-m-wikipedia-org.translate.goog/wiki/Stralsunder_Rathaus?_x_tr_sl=de&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp).*
